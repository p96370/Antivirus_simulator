    The given tasks were solved in both programming languages C and Python and
used the exact same ideas, which is exactly why only the code in C has 
commentaries.
    The problem is split into 2 tasks so they were solved separately.
    The first task consists of recognizing the malicious URLS. The program has
4 functions: check_database(), check_malware(), check_digits() and check_www().
-check_database(char *s): it checks if the current line contains any of the 
                          strings in the given database, it returns 1 if the 
                          URL is malicious and 0 otherwise
-check_malware(char *s): it checks if the current line is of executable type
-check_digits(char *s): it checks if more than 10% of the characters in the 
                        domain are check_digits
-check_www(char *s): it checks if 'www' are written in a normal format
    If any of the first 3 functions returns 1 it means that the current URL is
malicious and the program prints 1. Otherwise it checks if the 'www' exists and
is in a valid form. If the last function returns 1 it means the URL is still
malicious and the program prints 1, and if it return 0 the program prints 0.

    The second task consists of tracking the bad internet traffic and the
program uses 2 functions to do that: valid_flow_time() and valid_flow_pkts().
-valid_flow_time(char *s): it checks if the duration of traffic is higher than 
                           1 second, returns 1 if the duration is valid and
                           0 otherwise
-valid_flow_pkts(char *s): it checks if the current line ends with '.0.0', 
                           which is a valid format, returns 1 if it's valid 
                           and 0 otherwise
    If the first function returns 1 it means that the traffic takes less than 
a second so it's valid and the program prints 0. If it return 0 but the data 
ends with '.0.0' it's still valid so the program prints also 0. If both of the
functions return 0 then the traffic is suspect and the program prints 1.
